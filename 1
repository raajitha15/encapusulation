/* Program to demostrate the use of encapsulation in java
encapuslation : the process of wrapping the data and methods togerther
as a single unit.
how to achieve encapusulation?
Ans: 1. make the class variable private.
     2. create setter method and make the setter public.
	 3. create getter method and make the getter public.
	 4. take another class to access the class variable of the previous class
	 without using inheritances(you can also try with inheritances)*/

class Encap1 
{
	private int n=20;//securing the data by declaring variable as private
}

class TestLead
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Encap1 e=new Encap1();
		System.out.println(e.n);
			
	}
}

/*n has private access in Encap1
                System.out.println(e.n);*/
				/*if anyone will want to access the data then he/she should access the data
only by the method which is declared by the classname*/
